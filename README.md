# Holy Paladin Combat Rotation for Awful Framework

This repository contains the combat rotation for a Holy Paladin using the Awful Framework. The rotation is defined using a series of callback functions that dictate the behavior of the Holy Paladin under different conditions in the game.

## Content Overview

The repo includes various code snippets that define the behavior of the Holy Paladin under different conditions. Here are some highlights:

- **HammerOfJustice**: This function defines the behavior when the Hammer of Justice spell is cast. It includes conditions for casting the spell on an enemy, such as when the enemy is stealthy or when the player's health points are below a certain threshold.

- **TurnEvil**: This function defines the behavior when the Turn Evil spell is cast. It includes conditions for casting the spell on enemy pets and enemies within a certain range.

- **DivineProtection**: This function defines the behavior when the Divine Protection spell is cast. It includes conditions for casting the spell on the player, such as when the player's health points are below a certain threshold.

- **DivineSacrifice**: This function defines the behavior when the Divine Sacrifice spell is cast. It includes conditions for casting the spell on a friend, such as when the friend's health points are below a certain threshold.

- **SealOfWisdom**: This function defines the behavior when the Seal of Wisdom spell is cast. It includes conditions for casting the spell on the player, such as when the player does not have the Seal of Wisdom buff.
